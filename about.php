    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Orillia, ON. Even as a child I had a keen interest in computers and games. My parents bought me a toy electronics kit for Christmas one year and that sparked an interest in computers for me. My first console was a used Super Nintendo Entertainment System which I used to play hours of Yoshi's Island on. I took a computer technology course in high school which featured a Pascal-like programming language called Turing. And now I currently study at Georgian College, taking their three year program Computer Programmer/Analyst. </p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I enjoy chess, hiking, road biking, Magic: The Gathering. I enjoy playing video games such as StarCraft, League of Legends and just about any N64 game.</p>
