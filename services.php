        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Focusing on strongly structured HTML(5), I build websites from the ground up. Combining my understanding of server-side scripting with knowledge of how end client will be using the site, I build functionally robust sites. I achieve this by incorperating PHP and MySQL into the design of my site.

        <h2>Database Management</h2>
        <p>Managing a database to run efficiently and effectively is a complicated prospect. I have designed databases from scratch and I have exported data from database applications such as MS Access.
