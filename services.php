        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Focusing on strongly structured HTML(5), I build websites from the ground up. Combining my understanding of server-side scripting with knowledge of how end client will be using the site, I build functionally robust sites. I achieve this by incorperating PHP and MySQL into the design of my site.

        <h2>Database Management</h2>
        <p>Managing a database to run efficiently and effectively is a complicated prospect. I have designed databases from scratch and I have exported data from database applications such as MS Access. I use a base of second normal form for my tables which leads to a strong enforcement of good data. Good data means reliable SQL queries and a more efficient experience for users and admins alike.

        <h2>Web Design</h2>
        <p>Client side programming requires a deep understanding of semantic markup. Using CSS3, JavaScript plugins and HTML5 in concert, I design interfaces for websites that are clear and easy to use.
